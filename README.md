Hello, My name is Manoj Ambati. I'm currently pursuing my master's in Computer Science, this is my third semester at Villanova.

Motivation:
I have taken IOT course in my undergrad but it was mostly theory oriented like the different levels, protocols in IOT. However, I did not get much hands-on experience with IOT devices due to COVID. So I wanted to have some more in-depth knowledge in the ever growing IOT domain. I'm interested to explore more IOT applications using AWS. One of my favorite IOT applications has to be in the automobile industry, especially aspects such as Self-driving and Remote access.
